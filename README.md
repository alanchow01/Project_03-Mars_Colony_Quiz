# Project 3 - React.js Mars App

## Project Summary
A one page app to quiz potential Martian Colonists; built using React.js. The project features an introduction page; 3 timed quiz questions; results pages (fail or pass); and a 404 page. CSS animations were also used to add visual interest to select pages.

## Tools Used
- React.js
- CSS animation
- Gulp, SASS, BrowserSync, Autoprefixer, Web-pack
- Git and GitHub

## Experiences
This was a very challenging but rewarding project using React.js. It took a while to adjust to the thinking behind React and how to use states and props. However once patterns in writing the code started to become apparent, I started to understand how React works and look forward to coding more with this library.
