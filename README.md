# Project 3 - Mars Quiz (React)

## Project Summary
A one page app to quiz potential Martian Colonists; built using React. The project features an introduction page; 3 timed quiz questions; results pages (fail or pass); and a 404 page. CSS animations were also used to add visual interest to select pages. The end result required the user the answer all three questions correctly (within a time limit) before being accepted into the colonist program.

## Tools Used
- React
- CSS animation
- SASS
- Gulp, BrowserSync, Autoprefixer, Web-pack
- Git and GitHub

## Experiences
This was a very challenging but rewarding project using React. It took a while to adjust to the thinking behind React and how to use states and props. However once patterns in writing code started to appear and with a solid understanding of Props/States and how each affects the other, it began to become easier to write and understand. I love the modularity of React and how you can import already built components into your app and be able to use them without having to re-write code for each use case. I look forward to exploring and really learning the ins and outs of this framework.
